This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future.

We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months.
